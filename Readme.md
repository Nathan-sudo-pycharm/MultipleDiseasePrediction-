# Multiple Disease[ Diabetes and Parkinson's Disease] Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a machine learning app that can predict multiple diseases using machine learning. All these models can be accessed through a single web app built using Streamlit. All the prediction models are pre-trained on a large data set and can generate accurate results with input parameters for that particular disease.

## How to run

- Recommended to use Python 3.10.11
- Use a clean virtual env to avoid dependency clash

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nathan-sudo-pycharm/MultipleDiseasePrediction-.git
```

Open the project directory in your desired Python development environment and install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
